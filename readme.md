# Brest Validator

## About

Validator wrapper around [REST API library](https://www.npmjs.org/package/brest).

## How do I use it?

### 1. Install from package manager

```bash
$ npm install brest-validator --save
```

### 2 Setup
#### 2.1 Application file

In your application file, once you've created Brest instance

```javascript
	// Require brest library
	const Brest = require('brest');
	const BrestValidator = require('brest-validator');
	//...
		
	const brest = new Brest(require('./settings'), [BrestValidator]);
	brest.on('ready', function(){
		brest.use([]); //Required in Brest 0.4.7^
	});
```

#### 2.2 API script file structure

API scripts are expected to export object files with the following structure:

```javascript
const resource = {
    version: 1,
    description: "Resource description", //Description for the Docker
    endpoints: [
        //Here come the endpoint objects
    ]
}
```

Add validator (or validate) method to the API description. Use express-validator notation.

```javascript
const endpoint = {
    /**
     * Validation method. It is supposed to use express-validator (assertion part of it), but it can be
     * also used as a custom validator. Any data returned by this method will be considered as an error message
     */    
    validator: function(req){
        req.assert('fooId').notEmpty().isNumeric();
    }
//...

}
```
